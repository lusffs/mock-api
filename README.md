# mock-api
A simple node application to mock an API backend

## Setup

Clone repo and run `yarn` in root folder.

The contents of the api-folder mirrors the mocked api. 

All folders should have a singel `response.json`-file that will be returned to the calling user.

Run `yarn start` to start application. 

The API stucture should be printed in the terminal.
